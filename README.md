Send broadcasts to friends near your location! 
## Inspiration
We wanted to use technology to encourage connection and community offline and combat isolation. A lot of technology seeks to improve connection but only online, leading people to retreat into the internet and ultimately feel alone because of a lack of real, in-person community. 

What if there was an easier way to find people around you who are available to spend time together on the fly? To find a buddy to walk home at night with or to study for the same class with or to join you to run errands? 

Some apps, like Find My Friends, allow users to view which of their friends are geographically close to them, but there are challenges to utilizing this information to promote in-person connection: a) users have to share their exact location, all the time, which can conflict with the desire for privacy, b) there is an additional barrier of availability; it can be demoralizing to contact several people to determine if they are able to join you, and c) it’s only limited to iPhone users.

## What it does
Our app, “Flock”, promotes social connection offline, helping users to actually meet up with friends who are in convenient proximity to them. Think of it as “Find My Friends” but with text blasts. Users send a broadcast, or a “pidge” (short for pigeon) to any friends within a certain radius of them, to invite people to join them. 

It’s meant to encourage local community and spontaneity, grounding connections in the tangible and offline. This is what sets us apart from other social media apps. The app itself isn’t meant to take a lot of time to use but instead promotes engagement outside of your phone (less screen time, more time touching grass). 
See which friends are nearby and free to meet up on the fly. Whether you need a study buddy, someone to walk home with, or just want company running errands, Flock makes it easy to connect in real life.
Flock promotes safety, too. Walking home alone at night and feeling a bit nervous? Just send a quick message to see who's nearby and free to walk with you. Flock serves as a digital buddy system, so you can feel safer getting home.
Less screen time, more face-to-face connection
